# Building BMChain

## Compile-Time Options (cmake)

### CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Release/Debug]

Specifies whether to build with or without optimization and without or with
the symbol table for debugging. Unless you are specifically debugging or
running tests, it is recommended to build as release.

### LOW_MEMORY_NODE=[OFF/ON]

Builds steemd to be a consensus-only low memory node. Data and fields not
needed for consensus are not stored in the object database.  This option is
recommended for witnesses and seed-nodes.

### CLEAR_VOTES=[ON/OFF]

Clears old votes from memory that are no longer required for consensus.

### BUILD_STEEM_TESTNET=[OFF/ON]

Builds BMChain for use in a private testnet. Also required for building unit tests.

### SKIP_BY_TX_ID=[OFF/ON]

By default this is off. Enabling will prevent the account history plugin querying transactions 
by id, but saving around 65% of CPU time when reindexing. Enabling this option is a
huge gain if you do not need this functionality.

## Building on Ubuntu 16.04

For Ubuntu 16.04 users, after installing the right packages with `apt` BMChain
will build out of the box without further effort:

    cd steem
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    make -j$(nproc) steemd
    make -j$(nproc) cli_wallet
    # optional
    make install  # defaults to /usr/local
